  <h1>Tiago Rodrigues</h1>
  <article>
    <p>I am a Portuguese webdeveloper, currently living in London.</p>
    <p>I have been working as a webdeveloper since 2005, initially developing full websites but then transitioning more specifically to frontend development and JavaScript development.</p>
    <p>I focus on quick and simple but properly done application development, always seeking the perfect balance between quick development, maintainability and performance.</p>
    <p>I ocasionally do some public speaking and I frequently attend conferences and other community events. I also get involved in different open source communities in various ways, through some code contributions, helping in online communities and talking and writing about the software I use and my experiences with it.</p>
